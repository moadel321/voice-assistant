# Voice Assistant Project

This project implements a voice assistant that can transcribe speech to text using a Hugging Face inference endpoint and generate responses using OpenAI's GPT-4.

## Features
- Audio recording using the spacebar as a push-to-talk mechanism
- Speech-to-text transcription using a Hugging Face inference endpoint
- Text generation using OpenAI's GPT-4
- Proper display of Arabic text (right-to-left)
- Latency logging for performance analysis

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: (list all required packages)

## Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up your Hugging Face and OpenAI API keys (instructions on how to do this)

## Usage
Run the script with: `python voice_agent.py`

Press and hold the spacebar to speak, release to process the audio and get a response.
